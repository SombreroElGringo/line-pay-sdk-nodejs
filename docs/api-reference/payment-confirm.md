# Payment Confirm

This API is used for a Merchant to complete its payment. The Merchant must call Confirm Payment API to actually complete the payment. However, when "capture" parameter is "false" on payment reservation, the payment status becomes AUTHORIZATION, and the payment is completed only after "Capture API" is called.

## Type signature

```typescript
class Client {
    confirmPayment(options: OptionsConfirmPayment): Promise<any>
    ...
}
```

The type of OptionsConfirmPayment :
```typescript
type OptionsConfirmPayment = {
  /**
   * Payment amount
   */
  amount: number;
  /**
   * Currency following ([ISO 4218](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217))
   * Supported currencies are as follows:
   *
   * - USD
   * - JPY
   * - TWD

   *

   */
  currency: "USD" | "JPY" | "TWD" | "THB";
  /**
   * A transaction ID issued by LINE Pay, for payment or refund.
   */
  transactionId: string;
};
```
